                            <h4>Manufacturing</h4>

                            <p>At Moxxpharma Private Labeling all of our products are manufactured in our state of the art facility to the exacting regulations and guidelines of Health Canada. What sets us apart from other white label manufacturers is that our productsâ€™ entire formulation takes place in the same facility that we manufacture in. Not only do we test and research your products, we manufacture them as well.</p>


                            <h5>Manufacturing Range </h5>
                            <p>Utilizing our wide array of supplements and proteins we are able to manufacture any sport nutrition product that your company needs. If you need a product that fits exacting specifications, that is no problem for our manufacturing team. We can also accommodate custom dietary needs as well. No matter if you are trying to manufacture a vegan product, vegetarian product, a gluten free product, or a keto friendly product, we have you covered. We have experience formulating products that not only fit specific dietary needs, but also taste great as well.</p>
                            <h5>Why Should You Manufacture In Canada?</h5>
                            <p>Canadian manufactured supplements are held to stricter standards than supplements manufactured in other countries. These stricter standards mean we have to third party test our products for purity and quality. This adds several value points to your brand including reduced recalls, lab backed results for claims your products make, and a better overall safety. These factors can reduce your insurance costs while at the same time making your brand a premium brand.</p>

                            <h4>Manufacturing</h4>
                            <p>First impressions are everything, having the right packaging makes the best first impression. We have an in house graphics and packaging department to make sure your products make the very best impression with your buyers.</p>

                            <h5>Custom Packaging Options</h5>
                            <p>Our packaging options are one thing that sets us apart from the competition. We can work with any packaging type you can imagine. We can also source custom packaging that will further set your brand apart. Whether you want to use a Mylar bag or a resealable, recyclable lined paper bag, we have you covered. Just let us know what your needs are and we can accommodate them.</p>
                            <h5>Custom Labeling</h5>
                            <p>No idea what kind of label you want? Our graphics department can design complete labels around your existing logos or graphics. Are you wanting to sell in stores? If so, you will need UPC / bar codes for your products as well. If needed we can acquire them as well, so we can print the perfect label for your products. Let us know what you have and mind and we can make it a reality.</p>

                            <h4>Stock or Custom Formulations</h4>
                            <p>Do you have a formulation in mind for your products? Or maybe you just have a specific benchmark in mind, what ever the case we can work with either to create the perfect product. We have an extensive list of stock formulations that we can either use complete, or use as a starting point for your products and add ingredients to create the perfect mix for your market. What ever the case, we have you covered.</p>

                            <h5>Stock Formulations</h5>
                            <p>We have an extensive list of stock supplement formulations and protein shake formulations. If you are wanting to get up and selling quick, you can choose one of our off the shelf formulations to create a complete product line for your company or for your needs. All of our formulations are time-tested and researched to provide optimal results. No need to second guess our formulations, they have been used millions of time over.</p>
                            <h5>Custom Formulations</h5>
                            <p>Do you have specific benchmarks you are wanting to meet? Maybe it is grams of protein per serving, or maybe grams or micro-grams of another supplement per serving.  We can meet that with a custom formulation. We can also custom formulate our products to align with other more broad restrictions as well, such as vegan supplements or being gluten free. What ever you are looking for, we can make it happen.</p>

                            <h4>Logistics</h4>
                            <p>Our logistics team is one of the best in the world with handling the challenges of the ever changing logistics market.
