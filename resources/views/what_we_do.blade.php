                                    <h5>Why Should You Manufacture In Canada?</h5>
                                    <p>Canadian manufactured supplements are held to stricter standards than supplements
                                        manufactured in other countries. These stricter standards mean we have to third
                                        party test our products for purity and quality. This adds several value points
                                        to your brand including reduced recalls, lab backed results for claims your
                                        products make, and a better overall safety. These factors can reduce your
                                        insurance costs while at the same time making your brand a premium brand.</p>

                                    <h5>Custom Packaging Options</h5>

                                    <p>Our internal team of regulatory specialist can help with any regulatory issues
                                        that come up with your products. Most products, however, do not need any
                                        regulatory process. But in the instances where you are using a new supplement or
                                        compound that does, we can help. We have extensive experience in taking products
                                        from concept all the way through the regulatory process, getting approval to
                                        sell and also for the claims that are made.</p>
